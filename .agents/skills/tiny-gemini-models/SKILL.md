# tiny-gemini-models — Offline Gemini model registry

Use the `npx tiny-gemini models` command to **discover** Google Gemini models, pricing, capabilities, and deprecation status — without making any API call. Backed by an embedded snapshot of [ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) plus the pricing and deprecations pages, refreshed each CLI release. Part of the [tiny-gemini](../tiny-gemini/SKILL.md) suite.

## Scope

This skill owns every "ask about the Gemini API" verb (vs "use" the API):

| User intent | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| "what Gemini models exist?" | `models list` |
| "list image / audio / video / text / embedding / agent models" | `models list --type=<type>` |
| "show only GA / preview / deprecated models" | `models list --status=<status>` |
| "how much does Gemini Pro cost?" | `models pricing` |
| "give me the model registry as JSON" | `models list --json` |
| "which Gemini model should I use for X?" | Use the decision rules below |

### What NOT to handle here

| Sibling intent | Where it lives |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Actually calling a model** (text gen, image gen, TTS, research) | Core `tiny-gemini`, `tiny-gemini-image`, `tiny-gemini-tts`, `tiny-gemini-research` |
| Sending a raw request body | Core `tiny-gemini` `raw` command |

This skill is **offline** — no API key needed, no network call. It's pure reference / discovery.

## Configuration

**None.** The `models` command is fully offline — it reads the embedded `models.json` registry with no network call and no API key. (Actually *running* a model — text, images, audio, research — needs a Gemini key, but that is managed by the **CLI**, not by any skill — see the core [tiny-gemini](../tiny-gemini/SKILL.md) skill.)

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Full table
npx tiny-gemini models                       # alias for `models list`
npx tiny-gemini models list

# Filters (combinable, work on both `list` and `pricing`)
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=text
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=image
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=audio
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=video
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=embeddings
npx tiny-gemini models list --type=agent
npx tiny-gemini models list --status=ga
npx tiny-gemini models list --status=preview
npx tiny-gemini models list --status=deprecated

# Pricing-only view
npx tiny-gemini models pricing

# Machine-readable
npx tiny-gemini models list --json
```

## Output Shape (--json)

Each entry is an object with:

```json
{
  "id": "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  "type": "text",
  "status": "preview",
  "context_window": 1048576,
  "capabilities": ["text", "vision", "function_calling", "structured_output", "streaming", "google_search", "thinking"],
  "pricing": {
    "input_per_1m": 0.50,
    "output_per_1m": 3.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "notes": null
  },
  "deprecated_on": null,
  "shutdown_on": null,
  "replacement": null,
  "free_tier": true
}
```

Tiered models (e.g., `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) include `input_per_1m_over_200k` / `output_per_1m_over_200k`. Cache-pricing models include `cache_read_per_1m` and `cache_storage_per_1m_per_hour`. Deprecated models populate `deprecated_on`, `shutdown_on`, and `replacement`.

## Decision Rules — Which Model to Use

Apply in order. The FIRST match is your answer.

1. **Generating images and need professional quality / accurate text rendering?** → `gemini-3-pro-image`
2. **Generating images?** → `gemini-3.1-flash-image`
3. **Generating images at the lowest possible cost/latency, 1K acceptable?** → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image` (GA; the deprecated `gemini-2.5-flash-image` still serves until shutdown 2026-10-02)
4. **Generating speech from text?** → `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`
5. **Native speech-in / speech-out (not TTS)?** → `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`
6. **Generating or editing short video (720p, from text or an image)?** → `gemini-omni-flash-preview` (CLI `video` default; Veo `veo-3.1-generate-preview` via `raw` for higher-fidelity/longer clips)
7. **Multi-minute autonomous research?** → `deep-research-preview-04-2026` (or `-max-` for comprehensive)
8. **Multimodal embeddings?** → `gemini-embedding-2`
9. **Need Remote MCP integration?** → `gemini-2.5-flash` (Gemini 3 doesn't support it; this model shuts down 2026-10-16)
10. **Maximum reasoning quality regardless of cost?** → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`
11. **Cheapest text generation?** → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
12. **Need a GA (non-preview) flash model for agentic/coding, cost no object?** → `gemini-3.5-flash` (GA, $1.50/$9.00; the official replacement for `gemini-2.5-flash`)
13. **Everything else (text, multimodal understanding, function calling, structured output, streaming)?** → `gemini-3-flash-preview` (best value, the CLI's text default)

## Sunset Calendar

Shutdown dates differ per model. Passing a sunsetting model via `--model` triggers a stderr deprecation warning until its date; after that date the call fails fast.

| Sunset model | Shutdown | Replacement |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` | 2026-06-25 | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` (GA) |
| `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` | 2026-06-25 | `gemini-3-pro-image` (GA) |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | 2026-10-02 | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | 2026-10-16 | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | 2026-10-16 | `gemini-3.5-flash` |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | 2026-10-16 | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` |

Note: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` is **not** deprecated — it's still listed as active Preview on Google's models page.

## Updating the Registry

The registry snapshot ships with the CLI as `models.json`. To refresh, update the `tiny-gemini` npm package itself (`npm update -g tiny-gemini` or just use `npx tiny-gemini@latest`). The skill version isn't tied to model registry refreshes — that's controlled by the CLI's release cadence.

## Constraints

- ALWAYS use `npx tiny-gemini models` (no API key needed, no network call)
- NEVER fabricate model IDs not present in the registry — run the command first to verify
- The registry is a **snapshot** — for breaking changes between snapshots, check https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog
- For the live registry from Google's API (vs the embedded snapshot), call `GET https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models` directly with curl — pricing isn't included in the API response, only the embedded snapshot has that
- Recommend a model BEFORE the user runs a command — the cheapest path is to check `models list --type=<X>` first, then pick the right `--model` for the calling command
